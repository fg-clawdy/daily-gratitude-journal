  "security": "Local-only app with no backend: No authentication required (local-only data), no API endpoints to secure, no sensitive data transmitted over network, localStorage data accessible only to same origin, XSS prevention via React's built-in escaping. Input validation: Character limit enforced client-side (500 chars), HTML escaping handled by React (automatic). Browser security: localStorage scoped to domain (same-origin policy), no third-party scripts loaded, CSP headers configured.",

Responsive layout: Primary design for 375px-428px (iPhone SE to Pro Max), no horizontal scrolling on any viewport, text area scales to fill available height. Performance: Static site (no server requests after initial load), auto-save debounced (reduce localStorage writes), calendar renders only visible month. Accessibility: Touch targets meet iOS/Android guidelines, color contrast meets WCAG AA standards, font sizes readable on mobile (18px minimum), tab navigation reachable with thumb on bottom of screen.",
  "operations": "Deployment: Vercel (recommended) via GitHub integration, static export (no server-side rendering), CDN distribution. Environment variables: None required (local-only app). Build command: npm run build. Output directory: out/ (Next.js static export). Health check: N/A (static site, no backend), monitor via Vercel uptime monitoring. Monitoring: Vercel Analytics for page views (optional), Browser DevTools for client-side errors, localStorage usage monitoring (warn at 4MB of 5MB limit). Scaling: N/A (static site scales automatically via CDN). Maintenance: localStorage limit warning, browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox latest 2 versions), data migration function if schema changes. Troubleshooting: localStorage full warning, data corruption validation with reset to empty state. Backup: N/A (local-only app, users can manually export data in future feature).",
  "implementation": "Tech stack: Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, localStorage, Vercel deployment. File structure: src/app/ (layout, page, today/, calendar/), src/components/ (TodayView, CalendarView, TabNavigation, CharacterCounter), src/lib/storage.ts (localStorage helpers), src/types/index.ts. Data model: localStorage key 'gratitude-entries' with version 'v1' and entries object { 'YYYY-MM-DD': 'entry text' }. Key functions: saveEntry, getEntry, getAllEntries, getDatesWithEntries. Performance: Auto-save debounced 500ms, calendar renders only current month, localStorage limit check before write (~5MB), lazy load calendar view."
